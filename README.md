MNIST Digit Recognition
Overview
The MNIST Digit Recognition project is a fundamental machine learning task where the goal is to classify handwritten digits from 0 to 9 using the MNIST dataset. This dataset is widely used for training and testing machine learning and deep learning models, especially in image classification.

Dataset
The dataset consists of 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits, each labeled with the digit it represents (0-9).

Training Set: 60,000 images
Test Set: 10,000 images
Each image is represented by a 28x28 matrix (or 784 pixels), where the pixel intensity varies from 0 (black) to 255 (white).

How to Run the Project
Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook (optional, for running notebooks)
Required libraries listed in requirements.txt:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Instructions
Download the dataset: The MNIST dataset is available via popular libraries like tensorflow or keras. It will automatically download the dataset when you run the code.

Train the model:

You can train the model by running the script:
bash
Copy code
python train.py
Alternatively, you can explore the model and run experiments using the provided Jupyter notebooks in the notebooks/ folder.
Evaluate the model:

After training, the model will be saved in the models/ directory. You can evaluate the trained model on the test set by running the evaluation code in train.py or the provided notebooks.
Model Architecture
The model used in this project is a simple neural network built using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) or a fully connected neural network (depending on the approach taken).

CNN Example:
Conv Layer 1: 32 filters, 3x3 kernel, ReLU activation
MaxPooling: 2x2
Conv Layer 2: 64 filters, 3x3 kernel, ReLU activation
MaxPooling: 2x2
Dense Layer: 128 units, ReLU activation
Output Layer: 10 units (softmax for multi-class classification)
Results
The model achieves over 99% accuracy on the test set after training.
Example Output:
Digit	Predicted Label
3	3
7	7
1	1
Future Work
Implement data augmentation techniques to further improve accuracy.
Experiment with different neural network architectures such as deeper CNNs or fully connected networks.
Apply transfer learning using pre-trained models on other datasets.
